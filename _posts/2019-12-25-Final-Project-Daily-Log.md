Title: Final Project Daily Log
---

Below is a log of my daily progress, including:

1.) What I worked on today

2.) What I learned

3.) Any road blocks or questions that I need to get answered

4.) What my goals are for tomorrow

**January 7th**


Today I researched what neural networks actually and the different methods for programming them. I looked into PyTorch, TensorFlow, and Keras. With my experience in Python, I decided that I will use PyTorch for the project because of its Pythonic nature. Overall, I learned that neural networks are algorithms that use pattern recognition to interpret data with labeling or clustering. My goal for tomorrow is to actually learn how to utilize PyTorch.


**January 8th**
Today I started learning how to actually use PyTorch with an example with gradient descent. I read a very detailed article that examined how to execute gradient descent, while comparing methods with Numpy and PyTorch. The article generally reviewed each of the main components of PyTorch and then explained how they were used in the gradient descent example. I feel that I learned the bare bones of PyTorch (autogrid, dynamic computation graph, model classes) today. My goal for tomorrow is to decide on how I want to apply neural networks. I want to determine what the actual project is and how it will utilize neural networks.
